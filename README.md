Project Title: Interactive Number Guessing Game

Overview: The Interactive Number Guessing Game is a console-based application developed in Python, aimed at providing users with an engaging and challenging experience as they attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game emphasizes user input validation, providing clear feedback to guide players toward making correct guesses. This project is designed to help beginners understand fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, input handling, and basic error checking.

Features:

User-Friendly Input: The game begins by prompting the user to input the lowest and highest values for the guessing range, ensuring these inputs are valid numbers.

Random Number Generation: Utilizes Python's random module to generate a secret number within the user-specified range.

Attempt Limits: Players can specify the number of attempts they wish to have, adding a layer of difficulty and strategy to the game.

Real-Time Feedback: Provides immediate feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or out of range.

Victory and Defeat Messages: Conveys clear messages upon winning (correct guess) or losing (exceeding the number of attempts).

Robust Input Handling: Ensures all inputs are valid, prompting users to re-enter data when invalid entries are detected.

Goals:

To enhance user engagement and enjoyment through interactive gameplay.

To offer a practical exercise for learning basic Python programming concepts.

To demonstrate effective input validation and error handling.

Potential Extensions:

Incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more visually appealing experience.

Adding difficulty levels with varying ranges and attempt limits.

Implementing a scoring system to track and compare performance across multiple sessions.
